Hello Trusted Volunteers,

Hopefully everyone has signed up for shifts! If you run into any trouble, just let us know!

Remember that at this point, we trust you to be left alone to run the room for a while. Seize the opportunity and let's see some great work! We're trying out some new food again this year, and bringing back some popular things from last year (TACO BOWLS!!!) So bring your friends, come volunteer! 

The website is already live, staffsuite.magfe.st , same one as last year with the menu TBA.  We have the same suite and setup as last year location of suite, all listed on the site. If you're not a member of our facebook group, you might be want to consider joining to get updates from us!


If you need anything, please ask us!
